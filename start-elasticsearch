#If this is your first install, automatically load ElasticSearch on login with:
#    mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
#    ln -nfs /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/0.19.0/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
#    launchctl load -wF ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
#
#If this is an upgrade and you already have the homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist loaded:
#    launchctl unload -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
#    ln -nfs /usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/0.19.0/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
#    launchctl load -wF ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
#
#To stop the ElasticSearch daemon:
#    launchctl unload -wF ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.elasticsearch.plist
#
#To start ElasticSearch manually:
    elasticsearch -f -D es.config=/usr/local/Cellar/elasticsearch/0.19.0/config/elasticsearch.yml
#
#See the 'elasticsearch.yml' file for configuration options.
#
#You'll find the ElasticSearch log here:
#    open /usr/local/var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch_jippeholwerda.log
#
#The folder with cluster data is here:
#    open /usr/local/var/elasticsearch/elasticsearch_jippeholwerda/
